Liri is a command line prompt app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. To look up song information you have to start the app "node liri.js" then you type in spotify-this-song followed the song name you want. If the song name is more then one word you must add a + ie. Master+of+puppets. A full example is $ node liri spotify-this-song bodak+yellow

to search for movies you call on liri then you type in movie-this followed by the movie you want information on. If the movie name is more then one word you must add a + ie. The+Matrix.

 here is the link to the git hub pages app repo. https://guywithipod.github.io/Liri-Node-App/.

there is a screenshot of the working app titled liri screenshot.png


 the technologies used in the app are Axios, fs(built into vs code), the spotify api, the omdb api.

 My role in the devolopment of this app was everything! All of this code was written by me.
